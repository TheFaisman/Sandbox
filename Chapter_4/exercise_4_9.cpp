/*
    Try to calculate the number of rice grains that the inventor asked for in exercise 8 above.
    You'll find that the number is so large that it won't fit in an int or a double. Observe 
    what happens when th enumber gets too big. What is the largest number of squares for which
    you can calculate the approximate number of grains using a double?
