    Write a program where you first enter a set of name-and-value pairs,
    such as Joe 17 and Barbara 22. For each pair, add the name to a vector
    called names and the number to a vector called scores.

    Terminate input with NoName 0. Check that each name is unique and terminate
    with an error message if a name is entered twice. Write out all the (name, score)
    pairs, one per line.
