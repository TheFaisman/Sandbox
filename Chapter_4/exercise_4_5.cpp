/*
    Write a program that performs as a very simple calculator. Your calculator should be able
    to handle the four basic math operations - add, subtract, multiply, and divide - on two
    input values. Your program should prompt the user to enter three arguments. Two double
    values and a character to represent an operation.

    For eg. The input '53.1 34.3 +' should output "The sum of 43.1 and 34.3 is 87.4."
